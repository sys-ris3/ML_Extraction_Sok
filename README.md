# SoK: All You Need to Know About On-Device ML Model Extraction - The Gap Between Research and Practice

------------

This repository contains the open-source projects we evaluated in our paper: SoK: All You Need to Know About On-Device ML Model Extraction - The Gap Between Research and Practice. Our goal is to identify challenges in applying these projects to real-world ML models in practice. 

------------

**This repo contains the following:**

**Models –** a folder containing several sample ML models. A larger collection of real-world ML models can be shared by request for academic purposes.

**Evaluation –** the link to the original PCM repository, our README file giving an example of using PCM to measure the power consumption of a project.

**ModelXRay –** the original code repository of [ModelXRay](https://github.com/RiS3-Lab/ModelXRay), along with the author's original README file which we used for evaluation on our model files.

**AES - TFSecured –** the original code repository of [TFSecured](https://github.com/dneprDroid/tfsecured.git), along with the author's original README file which we used for evaluation on our model files.

**ShadowNet –** the original code repository of ShadowNet, along with the author's original README file which we used for evaluation on our model files.

**DeepSniffer** the original code repository of [DeepSniffer](https://github.com/xinghu7788/DeepSniffer), our patch for [DeepSniffer](https://github.com/xinghu7788/DeepSniffer), original README renamed to orig_README, and our new README providing an example of applying this project to a sample ML model in Models folder, and other useful documentation.

**ML-DOCTOR** the original code repository of [ML-DOCTOR](https://github.com/liuyugeng/ML-Doctor/tree/main), our patch for [ML-DOCTOR](https://github.com/liuyugeng/ML-Doctor/tree/main), original README renamed to orig_README, and our new README providing an example of applying this project to a sample ML model in Models folder, and other useful documentation.

**Adaptive Misinformation** the original code repository of [Adaptive Misinformation](https://github.com/sanjaykariyappa/adaptive_misinformation), our patch for [Adaptive Misinformation](https://github.com/sanjaykariyappa/adaptive_misinformation), original README renamed to orig_README, and our new README providing an example of applying this project to a sample ML model in Models folder, and other useful documentation.

**Prediction-Poisoning** the original code repository of [Prediction-Poisoning](https://github.com/tribhuvanesh/prediction-poisoning), our patch for [Prediction-Poisoning](https://github.com/tribhuvanesh/prediction-poisoning), original README renamed to orig_README, and our new README providing an example of applying this project to a sample ML model in Models folder, and other useful documentation.
