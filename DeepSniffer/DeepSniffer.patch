 # DeepSniffer
 DeepSniffer is a model extraction framework that predicts the model architecture of the victim models based on the architecture hints during their execution. Specifically, this project mainly provides the most important part: layer sequence prediction. The key concept of DeepSniffer is to transform the layer sequence to a sequence-to-sequence prediction problem.
 # Installation
-1) Install the Tensorflow v1.13, Pytorch v0.4.1, and Python 3.6.2.
+1) Install Python 3.6.2, then Tensorflow v1.13, and Pytorch v0.4.1, `or`
+` - conda create --name deepsniffer python=3.6.2, then`
+`-  pip install -r requirements.txt       # pip`
+
 2) Download the model checkpoint files from the [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JrTkT9C0klWFMK4x-KSMqvvPJ7k3TL6U?usp=sharing).

 # Workflow
 This project comprises of two parts: 1) Model extraction part: we provide the source code and data set for training and testing the layer sequence predictor which is the fundamental step for model extraction. 
 2) Adversarial attack example: In the further step, we also provide the source code and trained substitute model checkpoints to evaluate the effectiveness of the extracted models on adversarial attacks.
